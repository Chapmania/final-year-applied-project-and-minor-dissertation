# Initial Research Topics

## Chatbots
### What is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) piece of software that can dynamically simulate a realistic conversation or response with a user using natural language processing (NLP). 

### How do they work?
There are two types of chatbots – Rule-Based and Self-Learning. [CHATBOT: Architecture, design, & development][1]
With a Rule-Based, the bot can answer questions based on the rules it has be trained with. It will follow a very if/else approach and can seem very robotic and easy to fool. They are used for very simple queries.
With a Self-Learning approach, the bot can dynamically learn from user interaction with machine learning. They are more efficient than Rule-Based bots and can be broken down into two further types (Retrieval Based and Generative)
Retrieval Based: The bot determines a response from a list of predefined responses such as a database of conversations using heuristics. The context of the input message is used in the selection and can include information from previous messages (E.g. names, answers etc).
Generative: The bot can generate its own answers from a list of predefined responses, rather than taking the most suitable response it forms a reply word by word. This approached can generate the most realistic response if trained correctly but can be more difficult to program.

### What are the uses and benefits?
#### Uses
They are used in devices (Siri, Alexa etc), websites, mobiles apps and through telephone calls.
Today a lot of companies also have chatbots to engage with users for things such as customer service. An example of this is Intercom who use AI chatbots to answer roughly 29% of all users queries before they make it to a human. [Intercom AI Chatbot][2]

#### Benefits
* Save Time
* Save Money
* Provide Greater Customer Satisfaction
* Increase Customer Base
* Cut Down on Errors
* Add Good Humor

### Conclusion
From my research a Retrieval Based Self-Learning chatbot might be most suitable for our project. A predetermined list of responses would be provided that the bot could select from to form it’s reply to the user.

## Digital Twins
### What are Digital Twins?
Digital twins are virtualised replicas of physical devices that can be used to run simulations before actual devices are built and deployed in the real world. [NetworkWorld – What are Digital Twins][3]
The idea was initially proposed with NASA’s full-scale virtual test of space capsules, used to diagnose unforeseen problems in orbit, which eventually gave way to fully digital simulations. [The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles [4]

### Benefits of Digital Twins
* Reduced downtime and improved performance
* Improved productivity
* Reduced risk
* Lower maintenance costs by predicting maintenance issues before breakdowns occur
* Faster production times
* Improved customer service

### Conclusion
Our project will be used as a Digital Twin to provide a simulation of a training experience without having to physically hire actors, the Luas etc. This will cut down costs, risk, and deployment time.
